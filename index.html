                <h1 class="blue-title"> Best Babysitters in Town </h1>
                <p class="blue-text"> We are serious about having only amazing babysitters on our
                roster. They've all been Skype interviewed by a parent, have 1-2
                years of experience and can provide 2 childcare-related references.
                Our parent approval rate is through the roof. University and
                College students, long-time babysitters, ECE students. Only the best.

                <h1 class="blue-title">Safer for Everyone</h1>
                <p class="blue-text"> Parents want to decide who is babysitting for their kids.
                With us, you'll have all the necessary elements they need to make
                an informed decision on childcare - an interview, reference info and
                relevant babysitter experience. Babysitters are people's kids, too.
                Ws protect babyistter safety by not revealing their full identity
                online until they have agreed to meet a family. Everyone deserves to be safe.
